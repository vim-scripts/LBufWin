This plugin contains one command:                                             
                                                                              
:Ls |pattern|                                                                 
                                                                              
The command creates a location list containing all of the currently loaded    
buffers in vim.  It takes one (optional) argument.  If it is supplied, it is  
treated as a pattern, and only buffers matching that pattern will be          
displayed.                                                                    
                                                                              
Location lists are a feature of Vim 7 and up.  Please see :he location-list if
you are curious.
